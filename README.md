# Sample CPM Project
This sample project provides code snipets on how to call the REST api of the CPM service programmatically. 

# Prerequisites 
## Client Id and Client Secrets
Please refer to http://aka.ms/cpmapi for instructions on how to retrieve the necessary settings. This project assumes that you already have at least one topic id registered within the CPM system.

## NuGet packages
This sample project utilises a package called `Microsoft.Cpm.Api.Contracts` that is supplied and maintained by our team. We consider versions with a suffix of `-rtm` to be stable releases, however NuGet recognises them as prerelease versions.

### Visual Studio instructions
Please configure your NuGet package manager with the following feed details:
* Name: MCKP.CPM
* Source: https://microsoft.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/MCKP.CPM/nuget/v3/index.json

When searching for the package, please ensure that the "Include Prerelease" option is **selected**. Install the latest `*-rtm` version available.

### NuGet command line instructions
If you prefer to install the packages manually, use the following command:
```
Install-Package Microsoft.Cpm.Api.Contracts -Source "https://microsoft.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/MCKP.CPM/nuget/v3/index.json" -Version 2.0.0-rtm-20170328-4 -Prerelease
```
Please note that you will have to locate what the latest version is.

### Getting access
If you keep getting a login screen when trying to add our NuGet feed to Visual Studio, it is most likely because your team does not have access to our internal NuGet feed. Please submit an access request through [https://aka.ms/wdgaccess](https://aka.ms/wdgaccess).

### Local installation
While access is being granted, you can temporarily unblock your development pipeline by retrieving an older version from the [Contact Permissions Master Sharepoint](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ContactPermissionsMaster/Shared%20Documents/Technical%20Stuff) and creating a local feed.
* Unzip the .zip package; you should see 2 .nupkg files.
* Place both .nupkg files in a folder of your choice.
* Add a new NuGet feed in VS, with the full path of the folder as the source.
* In the project, open the packages.config file and remove the `Microsoft.Cpm.Api.Contracts` reference.
* Open the feed and install the packages from there.

**Please note that the packages in the Sharepoint folder are NOT maintained!** Do follow up on your access request ASAP to enjoy the latest NuGet packages.
